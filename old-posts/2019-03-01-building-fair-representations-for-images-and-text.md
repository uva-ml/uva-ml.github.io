**Abstract** There has been an increased amount of attention on the societal consequences of deploying machine learning models for decision making. Machine learning models often make disparate decisions for different segments of the input population that correlate with protected variables such as race, gender, and age. A more problematic scenario in current systems, is their reliance on generic representations learned from large amounts of data and re-used for many downstream applications, e.g. pre-trained CNNs for images, and pre-trained word-embeddings for text. In our group, we have been studying problems of representation, where the objective is to build generic representations for images and text that do not encode information about protected variables. I will discuss some of our current work in this area in the domain of both images and text.
