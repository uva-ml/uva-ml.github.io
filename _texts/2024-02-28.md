**Abstract**
Machine learning's increasing integration raises significant privacy concerns. Current privacy auditing techniques for trained models are limited, primarily focusing on record-level privacy.  In this talk, I will introduce the notion of distribution inference, an inference threat that seeks to uncover private properties of the underlying training distribution. I will talk about our efforts in formalizing this threat model and developing corresponding attacks. The talk will also cover the broader shortcomings in present privacy auditing methods and propose research ideas that attempt to overcome these issues.


**Bio**
Anshuman Suri is a final year PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia, advised by Professor David Evans. His primary area of research is privacy/security in machine learning, with a focus on distribution inference.
