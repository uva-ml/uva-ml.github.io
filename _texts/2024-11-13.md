**Abstract**
In Strategic Classification, agents facing high-stakes decision settings may attempt to game the decision to increase their chance of obtaining a more favorable decision. The general model is the following: agents face a classifier and have a cost to modify their features in order to improve their chances of passing the classifier. The learner aims to compensate for this strategic behavior by making positive classification outcomes more difficult to obtain.

The standard setting of strategic classification, however, relies on strong and unrealistic assumptions: agents have a complete understanding of the deployed decision rule or classifier; strategic behavior is usually seen as ``gaming'', not as potentially a way to improve individuals truly; decisions are made in an offline and static fashion; and the goal is generally loss minimization without considerations of fairness nor social good.

The current talk aims to further push the understanding of strategic classification by challenging these assumptions and modeling choices. While the talk will aim to cover several of the ways in which one can relax the traditional assumptions of strategic classification, the main focus will be on i) the role of \emph{incomplete information and information asymmetries} in strategic classification and ii) on how this impacts fairness and social welfare across populations.
