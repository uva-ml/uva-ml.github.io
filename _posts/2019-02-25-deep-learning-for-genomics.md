**Abstract** Since the Human Genome project was completed in 2003, scientists have sought to discover the mechanisms by which DNA and its surrounding elements control biological processes. In this talk, I will introduce two essential biological processes related to the Genome and explain our work in using deep learning to predict and understand them. I will also discuss some of the open problems related to machine learning in Genomics.
